# Django DRF Project Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and start a Django DRF (Django Rest Framework) project.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- pip (Python package installer)
- Django (version 3.0 or higher)
- Django Rest Framework (DRF)

## Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.
3. Run the following command to create a virtual environment:
    ```
    python -m venv myenv
    ```

## Step 2: Activate the Virtual Environment
1. Activate the virtual environment by running the appropriate command based on your operating system:
    - For Windows:
      ```
      myenv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - For macOS/Linux:
      ```
      source myenv/bin/activate
      ```

## Step 3: Install Django and DRF
1. Make sure your virtual environment is activated.
2. Run the following command to install Django and DRF:
    ```
    pip install django djangorestframework
    ```

## Step 4: Create a Django Project
1. Run the following command to create a new Django project:
    ```
    django-admin startproject myproject
    ```

## Step 5: Create a Django App
1. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd myproject
    ```
2. Run the following command to create a new Django app:
    ```
    python manage.py startapp myapp
    ```

## Step 6: Configure Django Settings
1. Open the `settings.py` file located in the `myproject` directory.
2. Add `'rest_framework'` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list.
3. Configure the database settings according to your needs.

## Step 7: Create Django Models
1. Open the `models.py` file located in the `myapp` directory.
2. Define your Django models by creating Python classes.

## Step 8: Create Django Serializers
1. Create a new file called `serializers.py` in the `myapp` directory.
2. Define your Django serializers by extending the `serializers.ModelSerializer` class.

## Step 9: Create Django Views
1. Create a new file called `views.py` in the `myapp` directory.
2. Define your Django views by creating Python classes or functions.

## Step 10: Configure Django URLs
1. Open the `urls.py` file located in the `myproject` directory.
2. Add the necessary URL patterns to map your views.

## Step 11: Run the Django Development Server
1. Make sure your virtual environment is activated.
2. Run the following command to start the Django development server:
    ```
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

Congratulations! You have successfully set up and started your Django DRF project. You can now start building your API endpoints and testing them using tools like Postman.
